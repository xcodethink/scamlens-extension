## Detailed Description

ScamLens is the most advanced bookmark manager for Chrome, powered by AI to automatically organize, protect, and enhance your web collection.

**AI-Powered Organization**
Save any page with one click or Ctrl+Shift+S. Our AI instantly generates summaries and tags, so you spend less time organizing and more time browsing.

**Never Lose Content**
Take page snapshots at three levels - from lightweight text (10KB) to full visual archives with images (1MB). Even if a site goes down, your saved content remains accessible in the built-in reader mode.

**Dead Link Detection**
Automatic health checks scan your bookmarks for broken links on a schedule you choose (daily, weekly, or monthly). Two-strike confirmation prevents false positives.

**Semantic Search**
Find bookmarks by meaning, not just keywords. Our vector-based search understands context, so searching "machine learning tutorials" finds your AI course bookmarks even if they don't contain those exact words.

**Domain Intelligence**
Every bookmarked domain is automatically analyzed via RDAP for registration date, registrar, nameservers, and DNSSEC status - helping you spot suspicious newly-registered sites.

**Privacy First**
- All bookmarks stored locally in your browser
- Optional end-to-end encrypted cloud sync
- No tracking, no ads
- Open privacy policy at scamlens.org/privacy

**Plans**
- Free: 15 AI analyses/month, unlimited bookmarks
- Pro ($4.99/mo): 200 AI analyses, cloud sync, priority support
- Power ($9.99/mo): Unlimited AI, bring your own API key
