## Detailed Description

ScamLens - Smart Bookmarks is a powerful Chrome bookmark manager that uses AI to automatically organize, protect, and supercharge your web collection.

🤖 AI-Powered Organization
Save any page with one click or Ctrl+Shift+S. AI instantly generates a summary and relevant tags — no manual sorting needed.

📸 Page Snapshots — Never Lose Content
Capture pages at three levels: lightweight text (~10 KB), text with formatting (~100 KB), or full visual archive with images (~1 MB). Even if a site goes offline, your saved content stays readable in the built-in reader.

🔗 Dead Link Detection
Automatic health checks scan your bookmarks on a schedule you choose (daily, weekly, or monthly). A two-strike confirmation system avoids false positives from temporary outages.

🔍 Semantic Search
Find bookmarks by meaning, not just keywords. Vector-based search understands context — searching "machine learning tutorials" finds your AI course bookmarks even when those exact words aren't in the title.

🛡️ Domain Intelligence & Scam Protection
Every bookmarked domain is analyzed via WHOIS/RDAP for registration date, registrar, nameservers, and DNSSEC status. Spot suspicious newly registered or misconfigured sites at a glance. Full scam reports available at scamlens.org.

🔐 Privacy First
• All bookmarks stored locally in your browser — your data never leaves your device unless you choose cloud backup
• Optional end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) cloud sync across devices
• No tracking, no ads, no data selling

🔑 Flexible AI — Bring Your Own Key
